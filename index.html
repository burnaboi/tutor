      Hi! I'm Amy, a Maths graduate of Durham University. I've loved maths since I was very young and I'd love to pass on this passion to other students, so that those who lack confidence or even dislike maths can enjoy it, while achieving the best grade they possibly can! I have tutored students in almost every age group over the years, and have absolutely loved helping make that lightbulb moment happen every time!
      <br>
      I always start by ensuring you comprehend concepts entirely, so you have the foundational understanding needed for exam questions. I will happily go over concepts in various ways, using different explanations and methods until you are confident you understand them properly, so we can build on them. Then we’ll go through exam-style questions together so you have some guidance, and I see what areas you’re particularly struggling with, or where you could be losing vital marks. I also write down all essential formulae and methods so if you miss anything through the tutorial, or want the key points summarised, it’s all there for you in an easily digestible format. I want to push you to be the best you can be, with our sessions helping you to gain confidence as well as knowledge.

    <quote>“I started tutoring, hating math. As I keep on having tutoring sessions with Amy she helps me understand the math that I am working on and makes me look forward to working with her more in the future. For the first time I am not afraid to ask questions and don't feel like I'm being judged for not being the best at math.”</quote>
